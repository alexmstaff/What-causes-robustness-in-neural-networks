# Calculating the robustness of neural networks

This repository calculates the upper and lower bounds of neural networks. It uses the work of 
Akhilan Boopathy, Tsui-Wei Weng, Pin-Yu Chen, Sijia Liu and Luca Daniel, "CNN-Cert: An Efficient Framework for Certifying Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks", AAAI 2019.
